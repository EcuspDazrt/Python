Practice reading a text file using the Python language!

Create a text file that has a .txt extension and enter in a sentence or two.

Navigate back to your Python file that has a .py extension.

Inside your Python file create a variable and assign it to a command to open the text file. Make sure to include the r which means to read!

In a print statement, read the text file. This should print the contents of the text file to the console.
